# Welcome to `barbola-js`! What on earth is this?
Oh, heyo there. I(the creator of Barbola.js)'m exicited to tell you about us.

The modern NPM package for the web framework better than Solid.js the is used for user interfaces, that's exactly what Barbola is. We designed Barbola to be, as powerful as but better, than Solid.js (another great User Interface web framework). Unforganently, we don't have a website for documentation and other info for Barbola _just yet_, but we have a README.md right here for you.
